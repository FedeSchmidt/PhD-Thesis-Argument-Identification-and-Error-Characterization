# PhD Thesis - Argument Identification and Error Characterization

This repository contains code and resources for identifying arguments within natural language documents, following a sequence labeling approach.

We propose a characterization of the predictions made by a model designed to identify arguments, evaluating these predictions from an argumentation perspective.
This characterization introduces a new approach for the evaluation of segmentation models, specifically designed for Argument Mining.
The details of this work are presented in Chapter 4 of the PhD thesis.

The repository includes:
- `nbs/`: Source code for the project.
- `figures/`: Figures for the manuscript.
- `results/`: Includes an example file with predictions for the AAEC testing set. 

A fully trained model (a DistilBERT-based model trained on the AAEC dataset) can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14MlgNShAXBgcZ0X2vzIx3vlXxweF5Q59?usp=sharing.

Three datasets were used for the experiments, with references available in the manuscript.
