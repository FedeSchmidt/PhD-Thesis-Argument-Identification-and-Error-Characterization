with 2 2
the 2 2

at 2 2

. 0 0

what 1 1
the 2 0
government 2 0
should 2 2
do 2 0
immediately 2 0
is 2 2
to 2 2
strengthen 2 2

otherwise 0 0
, 0 0
the 0 1

never 0 1

whether 0 0

we 2 2

. 0 0

first 0 0
, 0 0
it 1 1
is 2 2
unfair 2 2
to 2 2

first 0 0
, 0 0
it 0 0
is 0 0
generally 0 0
understood 0 0
that 0 0
advertising 1 2
is 2 2
carried 2 2
out 2 2
with 2 2
the 2 2
main 2 2
purpose 2 2
of 2 2

. 0 0

advertisements 1 1
are 2 2
, 2 2
therefore 2 0
, 2 0
very 2 2
important 2 2
for 2 2

. 0 0

also 0 0
, 0 0
to 1 1

, 2 2
advertising 2 2
can 2 2
bring 2 2
them 2 2
many 2 2
benefits 2 2
. 0 0

for 0 0
example 0 0
, 0 0
customers 1 1
of 2 2

will 2 2
have 2 2
an 2 2
idea 2 2
about 2 2
the 2 2
current 2 2
offers 2 2
of 2 2
different 2 2
companies 2 2
and 0 0
hence 0 0
they 1 1
can 2 2
compare 2 2
them 2 2
and 2 2
then 2 2
have 2 2
a 2 2
better 2 2
decision 2 2
in 2 2
choosing 2 2
their 2 2
internet 2 2
or 2 2
mobile 2 2

plans 2 2
. 0 0

from 0 0
all 0 0
of 0 0
these 0 0
, 0 0
it 0 1
is 0 0
easy 0 0
to 0 0
see 0 0
why 0 0
the 0 0
idea 0 0
that 0 0
advertising 0 1
is 0 2
a 0 2
positive 0 2
part 0 2
of 0 2
life 0 2
will 0 2
garner 0 2
strong 0 2
support 0 2
. 0 0

however 0 0
, 0 0
it 0 0
can 0 0
be 0 0
seen 0 0
that 0 0
some 0 0
people 0 0
have 0 0
argued 0 0
against 0 0
advertising 0 0
due 0 0
to 0 0
its 0 0
negative 0 0
impacts 0 0
. 0 0

firstly 0 0
, 0 0
a 1 1
huge 2 2
amount 2 2
of 2 2
different 2 2
advertisements 2 2
could 2 2
be 2 2
sent 2 2
automatically 2 2
by 2 2
a 2 2
system 2 2
to 2 2
personal 2 2
phones 2 2
or 2 2
email 2 2
addresses 2 2
, 2 2
this 2 2
is 2 2
generally 2 2
known 2 2
as 2 2
spa 2 2
##m 2 2
, 2 2
and 2 2
causes 2 2
discomfort 2 2
or 2 2
even 2 2
annoyance 2 2
to 2 2
many 2 2
people 2 2
. 0 0

secondly 0 0
, 0 0
advertising 1 1
can 2 2
be 2 2
very 2 2
expensive 2 2
and 2 2
not 2 2
every 2 2
advertising 2 2
campaign 2 2
can 2 2
be 2 2
done 2 2
successfully 2 2
and 2 2
brings 2 2
good 2 2
results 2 2
. 0 0

therefore 0 0
, 0 0
advertising 1 1
is 2 2
believed 2 2
by 2 2
many 2 2
, 2 2
a 2 2
financial 2 2
burden 2 2
to 2 2
businesses 2 2
. 0 0

in 0 0
conclusion 0 0
, 0 0
after 0 0
analyzing 0 0
the 0 0
pro 0 0
##s 0 0
and 0 0

##s 0 0
of 0 0

both 0 0
of 0 0
the 0 0

strong 0 0

but 0 0
it 0 0
is 0 2
felt 0 0
that 0 2
more 1 2
good 2 2
comes 2 2
from 2 2
advertising 2 2
than 2 2
bad 2 2
. 0 0

thus 0 0
, 0 0
the 1 0
idea 2 0
that 2 0
advertising 2 1
is 2 2
a 2 2

the 0 0
first 0 0
and 0 0
foremost 0 0
reason 0 0
lies 0 0
in 0 0
the 0 0

that 0 0

some 2 2

a 2 2
fitting 2 2
example 2 2
of 2 2
which 2 2
can 2 2
be 2 2
found 2 2
in 2 2
my 2 2
experience 2 2
of 2 2
missing 2 2

i 1 1
just 2 2
failed 2 2
to 2 2
participate 2 2
in 2 2

because 0 0
i 1 1
thought 2 2
i 2 1
had 2 2
enough 2 2
time 2 2
for 2 2

breakfast 2 2

we 0 0

equally 0 0

aspect 0 0

keeping 1 1
in 2 2

from 2 2

generally 0 1
reason 0 0
behind 0 2
punishment 0 2
is 0 2
to 0 2
reduce 0 2
the 0 2
crime 0 2
from 0 2
a 0 2
nation 0 2

to 0 2

not 0 0

what 0 0
is 0 0
reason 0 0
behind 0 0
committing 0 0
a 0 0

therefore 0 0
there 0 1
should 0 2
be 0 2
fixed 0 2
punishment 0 0
for 0 2
a 0 2
specific 0 2
crime 0 2
. 0 0

alternatively 0 0
i 0 0
believe 0 0
that 0 0
it 1 1
should 2 2
taken 2 2
into 2 2
consideration 2 2
the 2 2
situation 2 2
and 2 2
conditions 2 2
, 2 2
that 2 2
forces 2 2
to 2 2
a 2 2
person 2 2
to 2 2
be 2 2
a 2 2
criminal 2 2
. 0 0

first 0 0
of 0 0
all 0 0
if 1 0
there 2 2
will 2 2
be 2 2
a 2 2
fixed 2 2
punishment 2 2
for 2 2
each 2 2
type 2 2
of 2 2
crime 2 2
then 2 0
it 2 2
will 2 2
lead 2 2
to 2 2
increase 2 2
the 2 2
crime 2 2
because 0 0
the 1 1
punishment 2 2
will 2 2
be 2 2
clear 2 2
in 2 2
the 2 2
mind 2 2
of 2 2
professional 2 2
criminals 2 2
and 2 2
they 2 2
will 2 2
not 2 2
feel 2 2
fear 2 2
while 2 2
committing 2 2
a 2 2
crime 2 2

secondly 0 0
, 0 0
laws 1 1

rules 2 2
are 2 2
there 2 2
for 2 2
people 2 2
therefore 0 0
it 1 1
is 2 2
necessary 2 2
to 2 2
have 2 2
a 2 2
look 2 2
behind 2 2
crime 2 2
for 0 2

` 0 2
` 0 2
a 1 2
women 2 2
steals 2 2
feed 2 2
for 2 2
her 2 2

should 2 2
be 2 2
treated 2 2

who 2 2
steals 2 2

the 1 1
person 2 2
who 2 2
committed 2 2
crime 2 2
first 2 2
time 2 2
and 2 2
the 2 2
professional 2 2
criminals 2 2
should 2 2
not 2 2
be 2 2
imprisoned 2 2
at 2 2
same 2 2
place 2 2
. 0 0

on 0 0
the 0 0
contrary 0 0
, 0 0
fixed 1 1
punishment 2 2
will 2 2
reduce 2 2
the 2 2
time 2 2
taken 2 2
by 2 2
judges 2 2
to 2 2
give 2 2
their 2 2
judgement 2 2
and 2 2
it 2 2
will 2 2
be 2 2
effective 2 2
economically 2 2
for 2 2
the 2 2
government 2 2
. 0 0

everyone 1 1
should 2 2
be 2 2
treated 2 2
equally 2 0
because 0 0
sometimes 1 1
we 2 0
see 2 0
that 2 0
a 2 2
poor 2 2
person 2 2
who 2 2
do 2 2
not 2 2
have 2 2
much 2 2
money 2 2
for 2 2
hiring 2 2
a 2 2
good 2 2
lawyer 2 2
they 2 2
get 2 2
imprisoned 2 2
even 2 2
without 2 2
committing 2 2
a 2 2
crime 2 2
and 2 2
when 2 2
they 2 2
come 2 2
back 2 2
to 2 2
the 2 2
society 2 2
they 2 2
become 2 2
a 2 2
professional 2 2
criminal 2 2
. 0 0

therefore 0 0
fixed 1 1
punishment 2 2
will 2 2
reduce 2 2
the 2 2
space 2 2
between 2 2
poor 2 2
and 2 2
rich 2 2
people 2 2
and 2 2
everyone 2 2
will 2 2
understand 2 2
the 2 2
importance 2 2
of 2 2
each 2 2
other 2 2
. 0 0

to 0 0
conclude 0 0
, 0 0
government 1 1

at 0 1
work 0 2
, 0 2
you 0 2
meet 0 2
people 0 2
with 0 2
diverse 0 2
backgrounds 0 2
and 0 2
you 0 2
are 0 2
required 0 2
to 0 2
maintain 0 2
sound 0 2
relationships 0 2
with 0 2

of 0 2

have 0 2
a 0 2
pleasant 0 2

, 0 0
the 0 1
relationship 0 2
you 0 2
need 0 2
to 0 2
maintain 0 2
with 0 2
your 0 2
co 0 2
- 0 2
worker 0 2
is 0 2
the 0 2
most 0 2
important 0 2
one 0 2
since 0 0
he 0 1
or 0 2
she 0 2
is 0 2
the 0 2
person 0 2
who 0 2
works 0 2
very 0 2
closely 0 2
with 0 2
you 0 2
, 0 2
and 0 2
in 0 2

you 0 2
have 0 2
to 0 2
rely 0 2
on 0 2
him 0 2

therefore 0 0
in 0 0
my 0 0
view 0 0
, 0 0
a 1 1
good 2 2
co 2 2

worker 2 2
needs 2 2
to 2 2
have 2 2
three 2 2
most 2 2
important 2 2
characteristics 2 2
such 2 2
as 2 2
cooperation 2 2

, 2 2
and 2 2
fellowship 2 2
. 0 0

the 1 1
co 2 2

be 2 2

if 1 1

lots 2 2

i 1 1
once 2 2
had 2 2

co 2 2

worker 2 2
who 2 2
was 2 2
too 2 2
family 2 2
conscious 2 2

therefore 0 0
he 1 1
always 2 2
left 2 2

giving 2 2
any 2 2

had 2 2
to 2 2
do 2 2
his 2 2
work 2 2
in 2 2
order 2 2
to 2 2
protect 2 2
him 2 2
from 2 2
getting 2 2
caught 2 2
to 2 2
the 2 2
supervisor 2 2
who 2 2
was 2 2
a 2 2
very 2 2
authoritative 2 2
person 2 2
. 0 0

however 0 0
, 0 0
one 1 1
day 2 2
i 2 2
wanted 2 2
to 2 2
be 2 2
off 2 2
early 2 2
because 2 0
i 2 1
had 2 2
to 2 2
take 2 2
my 2 2
mother 2 2
to 2 2
the 2 2
doctor 2 2
. 0 0

when 1 1
i 2 2
requested 2 2
my 2 2
co 2 2
- 2 2
worker 2 2
to 2 2
give 2 2
a 2 2
helping 2 2
hand 2 2
to 2 2
finish 2 2
my 2 2
work 2 2
early 2 2
, 2 2
he 2 2
turned 2 2
down 2 2
my 2 2
request 2 2
giving 2 2
a 2 2
silly 2 2
excuse 2 2
. 0 0

from 1 0
that 2 2
day 2 2
onwards 2 0
i 2 2
did 2 2
not 2 2
offer 2 2
him 2 2
any 2 2
support 2 2
and 2 2
finally 2 2
he 2 2
was 2 2
transferred 2 2
from 2 2
our 2 2
department 2 2
to 2 2
a 2 2
distant 2 2

to 1 0
a 2 0

his 2 0

was 2 2
valid 2 2
as 2 0
his 2 2
co 2 2

made 2 2
several 2 2
attempts 2 2
to 2 2
highlight 2 2
the 2 2

of 2 2

i 1 1
never 2 2

therefore 2 0
his 2 1

gave 2 2
up 2 2

therefore 0 0
, 0 0
exams 1 1
could 2 2
be 2 2
the 2 2
only 2 2
way 2 2
for 2 2

to 2 2
see 2 2
the 2 2

on 2 2

, 0 0
so 0 0
the 1 1
usage 2 2
of 2 2

tests 2 2
is 2 2
the 2 2
superior 2 2
option 2 2
for 2 2
them 2 2
. 0 0

additionally 0 0
, 0 0
standardized 1 1
tests 2 2
can 2 2
be 2 2
good 2 2
chance 2 2
for 2 2

to 2 2
apply 2 2
their 2 2
knowledge 2 2
on 2 2

since 0 0
, 0 0
some 1 1

may 2 2

however 0 0
, 0 0
standardized 1 1
tests 2 2
offer 2 2
them 2 2
such 2 2
chance 2 2
. 0 0

thus 0 0
, 0 0
it 0 0
is 0 0
clear 0 0
that 0 0
schools 1 1
should 2 2
require 2 2
students 2 2
to 2 2
take 2 2
standardized 2 2
tests 2 2
, 2 0
as 2 0
long 2 0

to 2 2
both 2 2

finally 0 0
, 0 0
i 0 0
think 0 0
that 0 0
requirement 1 1
to 2 2
take 2 2
standardized 2 2
tests 2 2
is 2 2
the 2 2
right 2 2
choice 2 2
, 0 0
since 0 0
in 1 1
this 2 0
case 2 2
teachers 2 1
can 2 2
compare 2 2
the 2 2
level 2 2
of 2 2

of 2 2
different 2 2
students 2 2
. 0 0

in 1 1
any 2 2
class 2 2
there 2 2
will 2 2
be 2 2
students 2 2
who 2 2
will 2 2
show 2 2
low 2 2
academic 2 2
performance 2 2
, 2 0
so 2 0
teachers 2 1
could 2 2
work 2 2
with 2 2

more 2 2
intensive 2 2

because 0 0
if 1 1

know 2 2
the 2 2

another 0 0
important 0 0

to 0 0

there 0 0
is 0 0
no 0 0
doubt 0 0
that 0 0
some 1 0

therefore 0 0

those 1 1
local 2 2
residents 2 2
have 2 2
to 2 2
clean 2 2
the 2 2
place 2 2

so 0 0
that 0 0
the 1 1
new 2 2

will 2 2
have 2 2
a 2 2
